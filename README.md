Attempt at making an APworld for REmake. Currently needs file locations in location .jsons and hard locations for chris. 
Do not have the info for the Door randomization in Benn Powells randomizer
Jill and Chris Normal are Functional. Jill is beatable;
due to Chris getting disposable keys for doors, may need multiple testing
Also need to add coding to recognize that "Jewelry Box - Stone Ring" and "Metal Object" makes a second "Metal and Stone Object"
